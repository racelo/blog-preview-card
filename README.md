## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It was my first project using Figma to analyze the project mockup and design requirements in detail. This allowed me to create a project that closely matched the mockup. Figma indeed makes the work of developers much easier since all the design requirements are laid out in Figma.

Additionally, since the project involves the implementation of CSS hover and focus states, I learned how to use transitions on elements when they are in such states. I actually have to revisit this subject because there are still plenty of things to know about CSS transitions.

### Continued development

I did not develop this project on mobile-first workflow and this is the area I want to focus on in my next projects.

### Useful resources

- [web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/css/transitions) - A very good introduction on CSS transitions. It helped me to quickly grasp the core concepts of CSS transitions.
